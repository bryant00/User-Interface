  <h2>My use of language and my cats</h2>
  <p>My cat’s behavior hasn’t changed much since her absence, except that she plays her new physique to the neighbors regularly, in an attempt to get pets.</p>
  <div lang="en-GB">
    <p>My other cat, colored black and white, is a sweetie. He followed us to the pool today, walking down the pavement with us. Yesterday he apparently visited our neighbours. I wonder if he recognizes that their flat is a mirror image of ours.</p>
    <p>Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used British English. But I’m supposed to write in American English. So I shouldn’t say "pavement" or "flat" or "color"...</p>
  </div>
  <p>I should say "sidewalk" and "apartment" and "color"!</p>
